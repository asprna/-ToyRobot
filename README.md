Solution Design:

	1. I have used fluent builder pattern for the implementation as it provides greater flexibity for object creations. 
	 
	2. I have choosen a console application for this task as it is simple enough to meet the requirements. 
	
	3. This application supports either robot commands from a text file or manual commands
	   Example text files can be found at \ToyRobot\SampleData

How to run the application:

	1. Run the exe "ToyRobot.exe" at \StandaloneExe
	2. It will ask if you have a text file or not.
	3. If you have a text file, type "Y", otherwise type "N"
	4. If you typed "Y", it will ask you to enter the file location. Please provide the full location.
	   Make sure the application has read permission to the file.
	5. Once it processes all the commands, it will report the robot location
	6. If you typed "N" at step 3, it will prompt you to enter the command.
	7. When you are done type "Exit" to exit.
